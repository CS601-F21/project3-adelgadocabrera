Don't care about not having perfect sound quality, although these are rated a 9.9 by me. Don't care about the weight, although these are very light. I'm just sad that the supply is shrinking. Must buy an extra set now before they run out. Same with the transmitter,Sony tmr-bt10a.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No Wires", "unixReviewTime": 1314230400, "reviewTime": "08 25, 2011"}
